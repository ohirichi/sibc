                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>The Staten Island Book Club was founded in 2017 by a small group of friends who all loved reading but realized they seemed to be doing less and less of it every year. They decided to pick a book each month, and read it together, meeting every week to discuss the stories and ideas they encountered. The club has steadily grown over the years and we are always looking for fellow book lovers to join us</p>

                <h3>What We Do</h3>
                <p>Like every good book club, our goal is to read at least one good book each month. Book of the month is chose by voting on the suggesstions given by members. Our weekly discussions focus on the ideas and concepts the authors explore in the book and the significance of these ideas in our lives and on society as whole.  We also conduct a writing workshop every other Friday for those members who wish to tell their own stories.</p>
